# Basic TCP Server

This repository contains a simple TCP server written in Go. It is designed for learning purposes and serves as a foundation for exploring networking concepts and building more complex server-client architectures.

## Features
- A basic TCP server that listens for incoming client connections.
- A TCP client to connect to the server and exchange messages.
- Simple message handling: The server responds to a client's message with a predefined response.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future features include:
- Supporting multiple client connections.
- Introducing secure communication with TLS/SSL.
- Building a custom communication protocol.
- Exploring data persistence and advanced error handling.
